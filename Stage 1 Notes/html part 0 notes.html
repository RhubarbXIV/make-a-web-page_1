      <h3>The Basics of the web</h3>
      <p>
        <em>HTML</em>, or hypertext markup language is the basic document type of the itnernet.
        When a computer browser requests a web page, a HTTP request is sent to a server, which typically fulfills said request by providing the corresponding HTML file, which is then in turn interpreted and displayed by a browser.

    <div class="topic"><a id="HTML_Introduction"></a>
      <h3>HTML introduction</h3>
        <p>
         So far in class we've discussed how HTML can be used to display text, images and links.
          Basic HTML is a good introduction to computing because it allows for an easy comparison between input and output, e.g. the difference between the markup language used and the interpreted result from the browser.
          It is commonly said that "computers are stupid," but I prefer to think of them as being hopelessly literal- only the most explicit well-formed instructions are going to have the desired effect.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic"><a id="HTML_Elements_and_Tags"></a>
        <h3>HTML elements and tags</h3>
          <p>
            The basic unit of HTML markup is called an <b>element</b>, which can represent a simple line break tag &lt;br&gt;, or a link to a site with a specific title: &lt;a href="url"&gt;"title"&lt;a/&gt;. In this case, the tag is the content within the brackets, "url" is a <b>value</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some elements are <b>inline</b>, and effect the text in just a specific place, while others are <b>block</b> elements, which can be said to form an invisible box around their content for manipulation.
            A line break is an example of the former, while a paragraph element is an example of the latter.

  <h2>Lecture 2</h2>
  <div class="topic"><a id="Webpages,_Documents,_and_Structure"></a>
    <h3>Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Webpages are, on a  high level, trees of boxes. Within the Document Object Model (DOM), HTML represents the "what" to display, and CSS (cascading style sheets) represents the "how"
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceptualizing webpages as trees of boxes seems to make liberal use of the &lt;div&gt; tag, often embedded within other &lt;div&gt; tags. This seems especially helpful as a starting point where boxes are first sketched out and then populated with the specific elements of the desired page.

    <h2>Lecture 3</h2>
    <div class="topic"><a id="Introduction_to_CSS"></a>
      <h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Style information about a HTML document is stored separately in a CSS file. The style file must be linked to the HTML file to be effective (use <em>link</em> tag)
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS applies to HTML elements with trivial specificity, exhibiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance" target="_blank">inheritance</a>. Put another way, embedded elements are said to <em>inherit</em> style information from the parent element, which in turn inherits its style information from its parent and so on and so on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic"><a id="The_Box_Model"></a>
      <h3>The Box Model</h3>
      <p>
        All HTML elements exist as theorteical "boxes" with margin, border, padding and content. All these attributes and more can be altered with instructions from a corresponding CSS document.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most complicated concepts in CSS is how these boxes are to be positioned. A powerful tool for managing box positioning is flexbox (click <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">here</a> for more information). This looks like a topic with lots of room for further exploration
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic"><a id="Avoiding_Repetition"></a>
      <h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most powerful applications of CSS, and by extension computer programming in general, is that it allows one to avoid repetitive instructions. This greatly benefits the designer of code, saving development time in writing out instructions and perhaps equally importantly, limiting the chances of making an error that causes a program to behave in an unexpected fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming classes in &lt;div&gt; elements, and then supplementing that class with style information from a corresponding CSS document is one example of how a developer might avoid repetition. All elements of the same class can be altered at once with a change to the style instructions contained within the CSS.
      </p>

    <div class="topic"><a id="Verification_of_HTML_and_CSS"></a>
      <h3>Verification of HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        It is important, especially for beginners, to verify their code performs as expected on a number of browsers in different situations. Some helpful tools for verifying HTML and CSS code can be found below:
